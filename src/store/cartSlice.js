/*
   - Slice: creating a "slice" is a way to organize and encapsulate parts of your Redux state and the corresponding logic for updating that state. 
   - Store: The big whiteboard where all the tasks (or the to-do list) are listed.
   - Reducers: You, the person in charge of updating the to-do list based on the requests.
   - Actions: The requests or commands (like adding, completing, or removing tasks) given to you to update the list.
